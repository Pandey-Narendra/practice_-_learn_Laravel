1) on join which table to put on side first
    It depends on what you want to preserve (include all rows from, even without matches)
    Start with (or prioritize) the "primary" table you must include all of, and join outwards.
    For LEFT JOIN: Put the table you want to preserve on the left side
    For RIGHT JOIN: Put the table you want to preserve on the right side

2) on group by or order by in joins which we should use for it 
    . GROUP BY is only needed when you're performing aggregates like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc., to collapse rows.
    Avoid if not aggregating to prevent unnecessary row collapsing.
